>MIS Capstone Project:

Focus: Business Intelligence Evaluation & Implementation
  
Collaborated with a team to evaluate and recommend a business intelligence dashboard platform for the university’s fundraising operations. Conducted comparative analysis between Power BI and Tableau across performance, integration, and user satisfaction metrics—including Python compatibility and data pipeline capabilities. Recommended Power BI based on its Python/Jupyter integration, collaborative scalability, and superior dashboard performance. Presented findings to a panel of university administrators, project managers, and engineers.
  
Key Skills: Data Analysis · Dashboard Tools · Stakeholder Communication · Python Integration · Research Presentation


>Operations Management Final Project

Focus: Operational Risk Mapping & Strategic Threat Analysis

Performed an in-depth risk assessment of Apple Inc. using frameworks such as cognitive mapping, connectivity graphs, and reverse stress testing. Identified interrelated risks across operational, financial, strategic, and market domains. Designed and presented a comprehensive risk wheel and probability-severity matrix to evaluate potential threats—including global competition, regulatory changes, and supply chain vulnerabilities.

Key Skills: Risk Analysis · Strategic Mapping · Business Research · Reverse Stress Testing · Visual Modeling · Operations Strategy


>Hacking 4 Diplomacy Final Project:

Focus: Threat Intelligence & Data Architecture for U.S. Federal Systems

Partnered with the U.S. Department of State through RIT’s Hacking 4 Diplomacy program to identify and solve complex cybersecurity challenges related to internal data sharing and incident response. Led research into the Department’s fragmented data systems across embassies and bureaus, analyzing risk exposures and inefficiencies. Conducted structured interviews with federal employees, cybersecurity professionals, and academic experts to gather qualitative intelligence.

Developed a threat-informed data architecture roadmap that included system centralization, intelligence fusion strategies, and integrations with AI-enhanced data pipelines. Proposed actionable solutions grounded in OSINT methods, intelligence analysis frameworks, and government policy constraints.

Final recommendations were presented to an audience of 200+ U.S. State Department officials, including cybersecurity officers, diplomatic staff, and IT leadership. The project was praised for its strategic clarity, systems-level thinking, and human-centric approach to security reform.

Key Deliverables:
-Stakeholder interview synthesis (DoS officers, analysts, faculty, and industry experts)

-Threat modeling diagrams and data flow visuals

-Comparative analysis of existing federal data systems

-Centralized intelligence-sharing architecture proposal

-Presentation and Q&A with federal cybersecurity leadership
